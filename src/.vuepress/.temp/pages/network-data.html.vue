<p>Right now, the Pixltonian Network is powered by Pre-Nodes, which are temporarily maintained by the Natural Selection Labs. We constantly upload all Pixltonian Files to a public <a href="https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Pixltonian-Network-Data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, where everyone can access.</p>
<p>We also provide a dashboard <a href="https://dashboard.Pixltonian.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dashboard.Pixltonian.dev<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> to visualize an overview of the current state.</p>
