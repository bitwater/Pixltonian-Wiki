<p>Throughout the much exciting $Pixltonian LBP auction, the dev team continued to work on <a href="https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Pixltonian-Protocol/tree/main/versions/v0.4.0-rc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixltonian Protocol v0.4.0<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> and <a href="https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Pixltonian-PreGod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixltonian Network PreGod<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>, a leap forward towards a truly decentralized information distribution architecture.</p>
<h2 id="what-has-happened" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-has-happened" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What has happened</h2>
<ol>
<li>Weâ€™ve polished our Pixltonian Protocol based on <a href="https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Pixltonian-Protocol/discussions/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the adventure<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>. Within the team, weâ€™ve ironed out some issues encountered in utilizing v0.3.1, and released simple type definition and examples for v0.4.0-rc. We expect v0.4.0 to be a stable version without introducing breaking changes anytime soon.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ve continued building the foundation for PreGod, which included tech stack choices (some tough calls were made) and some toolings.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ve finalized the design of the first version of PreGodâ€™s database schema, which is fully conformed to Pixltonian Protocol v0.4.0-rc. The design process also revealed some protocol structural issues, which allowed us to refine the v0.4.0-rc.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ve finalized the design of Pixltonian URI Specification, which will be used for routing and communication within PreGod.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ve established a direct channel of communication with our core developers, which is located in the <code>#ðŸ’¡meet-the-developers</code> channel of the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Pixltonian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixltonian Discord Server<ExternalLinkIcon/></a></li>

<h2 id="what-is-going-to-happen" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-going-to-happen" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is going to happen</h2>
<ol>
<li>As we aim to build PreGod to be as performant as possible, we will continue to lay a solid foundation. This may involve some further investigations into the tech stack.</li>
<li>We will be building the database logic for virtually everything PreGod.</li>
<li>We will start moving over some codebase written for PreNode that are reusable for PreGod. Some improvements will be made as well.</li>
<li>We will continue the exploration of interesting ideas and concepts (like <a href="https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SatoshiLabs Improvement Proposals<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> we discovered this week, which sparked a meaningful discussion among us) to inspire ourselves.</li>
<li>We will continue the research of v0.4.0 and soon release the detailed documentation for v0.4.0-rc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thatâ€™s it for the week, see you all next week!</p>
